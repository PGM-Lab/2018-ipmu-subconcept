*Paper submitted to BNAIC 2017 (under review)*

This repository contains the required material for the experimentation given in the paper.  In particular, it is organised as follows:

 - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcabanasdepaz/files/master/img/gitfolder_small.png) **R**: this folder contains all the R scripts for generating the data sets, modifying them, and creating the graphs with the results.


 - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcabanasdepaz/files/master/img/gitfolder_small.png) **datasets**:  this folder contains the data sets used in the experimentation (i.e., the synthetic and intrusion data sets) which are provided in multiple .arff files. 
 - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcabanasdepaz/files/master/img/gitfolder_small.png) **java**: maven project for running the experiments. This uses AMIDST 0.6.2. The code implementing the concept drift detector is given in this folder.
